# Week 04 - Sets - Part 1

  - Introduction    
    - Definition of set 
    - Definition of sets are equal
    - The empty set
    - Singleton set
  - Venn Diagrams
  - Subsets
    - **Theorem**: For every set $S$, (i) $\empty \subseteq S$ and $S \subseteq S$.
  - The size of a set
    - Definition of cardinality
  - Power sets
  
  **Optional**
  - The motivation for numbers system from natural numbers to complex
  - Representation natural numbers with empty set
    - $0 = \{\}$
    - $1 = \left\{\{\}\right\}$
    - $2 = 1 \cup \{1\} 
         = \bigg\{\big\{\{\}\big\}, 
                 \Big\{ \big\{\{\} \big\} \Big\} \bigg\}$
    - $3 = 2 \cup \{2\}
         = \left\{\bigg\{\big\{\{\}\big\}, 
                 \Big\{ \big\{\{\} \big\} \Big\} \bigg\},
            \left\{
          \bigg\{\big\{\{\}\big\}, 
                 \Big\{ \big\{\{\} \big\} \Big\} \bigg\} 
            \right\}
           \right\}$
  - The power set of an empty set.    
    Using the theorem about subset of an empty set and the set itself.
    An empty set is a subset of any set, $\{\} \subseteq \{\}$.  
    and a set is a subset of itself, $\{\} \subseteq \{\}$.  
    We have
    $$
      \mathcal{P}(\{\}) = \big\{\{\}, \{\}\big\}  
        = \big\{\{\}\big\}
    $$
  - The power set of a set contains an empty set.
  - Cartesian Products
    - Definition of ordered n-tuple
    - Definition of Cartesian product of the sets $A$ and $B$
    - Definition of Cartesian product more than two sets
    - Using set notation with quantifiers
    - Truth sets and quantifiers
