# Boolean algebra (part 01)

George Boole 1854 - The Laws of Thought

Claude Shannon 1938 showed how the basic rules of logic could be used
to design circuits

$$
\text{circuits} \rightarrow \text{Boolean function} 
  \rightarrow \text{efficient circuits}
$$

A map from Boolean function to efficient circuit can be done by several
algorithms such as Karnaugh maps and Quine-McCluskey method

## Boolean functions
- Introduction
- Boolean expressions and Boolean functions
- Identities of Boolean algebra
- Duality
- The abstract definition of a Boolean Algebra

## Representing Boolean Functions
  - Sum-of-product expansions
    - Definition of literal
  - (optional) functional completeness
