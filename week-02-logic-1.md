# Week 02 - Logic - Part 1

## Motivation

- A smartphone and a case cost $110 in total. The phone costs $100 more than 
  the case. How much does the case cost?

- It takes 8 printers 8 minutes to print 8 brochures. How long would it take 
  24 pinters to print 24 brochures?

- On a field there is a patch of weeds. Every day the patch doubles in size. 
  It takes 30 days  

- On a field there is a patch of weeds. Every day the patch doubles in size. 
  It takes 30 days for the patch to cover the whole field. How long
  did it take for the patch to cover half the field?

- What is Logic?
- Propositions
- Propositional variables
- Compound propositions
- Logical operators
  - Negation (unitary operator)
    - truth tables
  - Conjunction (AND)  (binary operator)
  - Disjunction (OR) (binary operator)
  - [optional] Exclusive or
- Conditional statements (see 2022-09-12-logic.xopp)
  - An example that reflects truth tables of conditional
    statements (obligation)
- Some variations of conditional statements $p \rightarrow q$
  - converse $q \rightarrow p$
  - contrapositive $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$
  - inverse  $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$
- Truth table of conditional statements, converse, contrapositive, 
  and inverse to see tautologies/equivalent between them.
